These are a couple files used in parsing and graphing of the data from the Canada Price Index Database and Census data. You will need them downloaded if you want to try them out (I suggest not since they are massive files).

Data from parser is specific data that I wanted to get for the purpose of comparing, analyzing and graphing.

Graphing
- I used R to graph all the data that was collected via my parser.
